Hi! I'm Atharva, also known as Axarva around the internet. I'm a Nepalese student currently in my final year at
high school. I am a sysadmin, a ricer (visit [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) for more details :)) and
a programmer mostly active in Open Source with a few small projects. 

I love Haskell and mostly write code in it. Apart from Haskell, I also sometimes write code in JavaScript and Python.
Go around this website to see more about the projects I'm working on. I'd love to get in touch too!
